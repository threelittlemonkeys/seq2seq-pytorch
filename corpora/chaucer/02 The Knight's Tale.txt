	Iamque domos patrias, Sithice post	And now (Theseus drawing nigh his) native land in
	aspera gentis prelia,laurigero, etc.	laurelled car after battling with the Scithian folk, etc.
859	Whilom, as olde stories tellen us,		Once, as old histories tell us,
860	Ther was a duc that highte Theseus;		There was a duke who was called Theseus;
861	Of Atthenes he was lord and governour,		He was lord and governor of Athens,
862	And in his tyme swich a conquerour		And in his time such a conqueror
863	That gretter was ther noon under the sonne.		That there was no one greater under the sun.
864	Ful many a riche contree hadde he wonne;		Very many a powerful country had he won;
865	What with his wysdom and his chivalrie,		What with his wisdom and his chivalry,
866	He conquered al the regne of Femenye,		He conquered all the land of the Amazons,
867	That whilom was ycleped Scithia,		That once was called Scithia,
868	And weddede the queene Ypolita,		And wedded the queen Ypolita,
869	And broghte hire hoom with hym in his contree		And brought her home with him into his country
870	With muchel glorie and greet solempnytee,		With much glory and great ceremony,
871	And eek hir yonge suster Emelye.		And also her young sister Emelye.
872	And thus with victorie and with melodye		And thus with victory and with festivity
873	Lete I this noble duc to Atthenes ryde,		I leave this noble duke riding to Athens,
874	And al his hoost in armes hym bisyde.		And all his host in arms beside him.
875	And certes, if it nere to long to heere,		And certainly, if it were not too long to hear,
876	I wolde have toold yow fully the manere		I would have told you fully the manner
877	How wonnen was the regne of Femenye		How the reign of Femenye was won
878	By Theseus and by his chivalrye;		By Theseus and by his chivalry;
879	And of the grete bataille for the nones		And of the great battle at that time
880	Bitwixen Atthenes and Amazones;		Between Athenians and Amazons;
881	And how asseged was Ypolita,		And how Ypolita was besieged,
882	The faire, hardy queene of Scithia;		The fair, bold queen of Scithia;
883	And of the feste that was at hir weddynge,		And of the festivity that was at their wedding,
884	And of the tempest at hir hoom-comynge;		And of the storm at her home-coming;
885	But al that thyng I moot as now forbere.		But all that matter I must now forgo.
886	I have, God woot, a large feeld to ere,		I have, God knows, a large field to till,
887	And wayke been the oxen in my plough.		And the oxen in my plow are weak.
888	The remenant of the tale is long ynough.		The remnant of the tale is long enough.
889	I wol nat letten eek noon of this route;		Also I will not hinder any one of this company;
890	Lat every felawe telle his tale aboute,		Let every fellow tell his tale in turn,
891	And lat se now who shal the soper wynne;		And let's see now who shall win the supper;
892	And ther I lefte, I wol ayeyn bigynne.		And where I left off, I will again begin.
893	This duc, of whom I make mencioun,		This duke, of whom I make mention,
894	Whan he was come almoost unto the toun,		When he was come almost unto the town,
895	In al his wele and in his mooste pride,		In all his prosperity and in his most pride,
896	He was war, as he caste his eye aside,		He was aware, as he cast his eye aside,
897	Where that ther kneled in the heighe weye		Where there kneeled in the high way
898	A compaignye of ladyes, tweye and tweye,		A company of ladies, two by two,
899	Ech after oother clad in clothes blake;		Each after another, clad in black clothes;
900	But swich a cry and swich a wo they make		But such a cry and such a woeful (lament) they make
901	That in this world nys creature lyvynge		That in this world is no living creature
902	That herde swich another waymentynge;		That (ever) heard lamentation such as this;
903	And of this cry they nolde nevere stenten		And of this cry they would not ever stop
904	Til they the reynes of his brydel henten.		Until they seized the reins of his bridle.
905	"What folk been ye, that at myn hom-comynge		"What folk are you, who at my homecoming
906	Perturben so my feste with criynge?"		So disturb my festival with crying?"
907	Quod Theseus. "Have ye so greet envye		Said Theseus. "Have you such great envy
908	Of myn honour, that thus compleyne and crye?		Of my honor, (you) who thus lament and cry?
909	Or who hath yow mysboden or offended?		Or who has injured or offended you?
910	And telleth me if it may been amended,		And tell me if it may be remedied,
911	And why that ye been clothed thus in blak."		And why you are clothed thus in black."
912	The eldeste lady of them alle spak,		The eldest lady of them all spoke,
913	Whan she hadde swowned with a deedly cheere,		After she had swooned with (so) deadly a countenance,
914	That it was routhe for to seen and heere;		That it was pitiful to see and hear;
915	She seyde, "Lord, to whom Fortune hath yiven		She said, "Lord, to whom Fortune has given
916	Victorie, and as a conqueror to lyven,		Victory, and (allowed) to live as a conqueror,
917	Nat greveth us youre glorie and youre honour,		Your glory and your honor does not grieve us,
918	But we biseken mercy and socour.		But we beseech (you for) mercy and succor.
919	Have mercy on oure wo and oure distresse!		Have mercy on our woe and our distress!
920	Som drope of pitee, thurgh thy gentillesse,		Some drop of pity, because of thy nobility,
921	Upon us wrecched wommen lat thou falle,		Let thou fall upon us wretched women,
922	For, certes, lord, ther is noon of us alle		For, certainly, lord, there is not one of us all
923	That she ne hath been a duchesse or a queene.		Who has not been a duchesse or a queen.
924	Now be we caytyves, as it is wel seene,		Now we are miserable wretches, as it is easily seen,
925	Thanked be Fortune and hire false wheel,		Thanks be to Fortune and her false wheel,
926	That noon estaat assureth to be weel.		Who assures no estate (will continue) to be well.
927	And certes, lord, to abyden youre presence,		And certainly, lord, to await your presence,
928	Heere in this temple of the goddesse Clemence		Here in this temple of the goddess Clemency
929	We han ben waitynge al this fourtenyght.		We have been waiting all this fortnight.
930	Now help us, lord, sith it is in thy myght.		Now help us, lord, since it is in thy power.
931	"I, wrecche, which that wepe and wayle thus,		"I, wretch, who weep and wail thus,
932	Was whilom wyf to kyng Cappaneus,		Was once wife to king Cappaneus,
933	That starf at Thebes -- cursed be that day! --		Who died at Thebes -- cursed be that day! --
934	And alle we that been in this array		And all of us who are in this condition
935	And maken al this lamentacioun,		And make all this lamentation,
936	We losten alle oure housbondes at that toun,		We lost all our husbands at that town,
937	Whil that the seege theraboute lay.		While the siege lay around it.
938	And yet now the olde Creon -- weylaway! --		And yet now the old Creon -- woe oh woe! --
939	That lord is now of Thebes the citee,		Who is now lord of the city of Thebes,
940	Fulfild of ire and of iniquitee,		Filled with anger and with iniquity,
941	He, for despit and for his tirannye,		He, for spite and for his tyranny,
942	To do the dede bodyes vileynye		To do dishonor to the dead bodies
943	Of alle oure lordes whiche that been yslawe,		Of all our lords who are slain,
944	Hath alle the bodyes on an heep ydrawe,		Has dragged all the bodies in a heap,
945	And wol nat suffren hem, by noon assent,		And will not allow them, not at all,
946	Neither to been yburyed nor ybrent,		Neither to be buried nor burned,
947	But maketh houndes ete them in despit."		But makes hounds eat them as an insult."
948	And with that word, withouten moore respit,		And with that word, without more delay,
949	They fillen gruf and criden pitously,		They fell face down and cried piteously,
950	"Have on us wrecched wommen som mercy,		"Have some mercy on us wretched women,
951	And lat oure sorwe synken in thyn herte."		And let our sorrow sink in thy heart."
952	This gentil duc doun from his courser sterte		This gentle duke leaped down from his war horse
953	With herte pitous, whan he herde them speke.		With compassionate heart, when he heard them speak.
954	Hym thoughte that his herte wolde breke,		It seemed to him that his heart would break,
955	Whan he saugh hem so pitous and so maat,		When he saw them so pitiful and so dejected,
956	That whilom weren of so greet estaat;		That once were of such high rank;
957	And in his armes he hem alle up hente,		And in his arms he caught up them all,
958	And hem conforteth in ful good entente,		And comforts them with very good will,
959	And swoor his ooth, as he was trewe knyght,		And swore his oath, as he was true knight,
960	He wolde doon so ferforthly his myght		(That) he would do his might so completely
961	Upon the tiraunt Creon hem to wreke		To avenge them upon the tyrant Creon
962	That al the peple of Grece sholde speke		That all the people of Greece should speak (about)
963	How Creon was of Theseus yserved		How Creon was treated by Theseus
964	As he that hadde his deeth ful wel deserved.		As one who had very well deserved his death.
965	And right anoon, withouten moore abood,		And right away, without more delay,
966	His baner he desplayeth, and forth rood		He displays his banner, and rode forth
967	To Thebes-ward, and al his hoost biside.		Toward Thebes, and all his army beside (him).
968	No neer Atthenes wolde he go ne ride,		He would not walk nor ride any nearer to Athens,
969	Ne take his ese fully half a day,		Nor take his ease fully half a day,
970	But onward on his wey that nyght he lay,		But that night he lay (camped) on his way,
971	And sente anon Ypolita the queene,		And sent straightway Ypolita the queen,
972	And Emelye, hir yonge suster sheene,		And Emelye, her beautiful young sister,
973	Unto the toun of Atthenes to dwelle,		Unto the town of Athens to dwell,
974	And forth he rit; ther is namoore to telle.		And forth he rides; there is no more to tell.
975	The rede statue of Mars, with spere and targe,		The red statue of Mars, with spear and shield,
976	So shyneth in his white baner large		So shines in his large white banner
977	That alle the feeldes glyteren up and doun;		That all the fields glitter all around;
978	And by his baner born is his penoun		And by his banner is carried his pennon
979	Of gold ful riche, in which ther was ybete		Of very rich gold, in which there was embroidered
980	The Mynotaur, which that he wan in Crete.		The Minotaur, which he defeated in Crete.
981	Thus rit this duc, thus rit this conquerour,		Thus rides this duke, thus rides this conqueror,
982	And in his hoost of chivalrie the flour,		And in his army the flower of chivalry,
983	Til that he cam to Thebes and alighte		Until he came to Thebes and dismounted
984	Faire in a feeld, ther as he thoughte to fighte.		Graciously in a field, where he intended to fight.
985	But shortly for to speken of this thyng,		But briefly to speak of this thing,
986	With Creon, which that was of Thebes kyng,		With Creon, who was king of Thebes,
987	He faught, and slough hym manly as a knyght		He fought, and slew him boldly as a knight
988	In pleyn bataille, and putte the folk to flyght;		In open battle, and put the army to flight;
989	And by assaut he wan the citee after,		And by assault he won the city afterwards,
990	And rente adoun bothe wall and sparre and rafter;		And tore down both wall and beam and rafter;
991	And to the ladyes he restored agayn		And he gave back to the ladies
992	The bones of hir freendes that were slayn,		The bones of their husbands who were slain,
993	To doon obsequies, as was tho the gyse.		To do obsequies, as was then the custom.
994	But it were al to longe for to devyse		But it would be all too long to describe
995	The grete clamour and the waymentynge		The great clamor and the lamentation
996	That the ladyes made at the brennynge		That the ladies made at the burning
997	Of the bodies, and the grete honour		Of the bodies, and the great honor
998	That Theseus, the noble conquerour,		That Theseus, the noble conqueror,
999	Dooth to the ladyes, whan they from hym wente;		Does to the ladies, when they went from him;
1000	But shortly for to telle is myn entente.		But briefly to tell is my intent.
1001	Whan that this worthy duc, this Theseus,		When this worthy duke, this Theseus,
1002	Hath Creon slayn and wonne Thebes thus,		Has slain Creon and thus won Thebes,
1003	Stille in that feeld he took al nyght his reste,		Still in that field he took all night his rest,
1004	And dide with al the contree as hym leste.		And did with all the country as he pleased.
1005	To ransake in the taas of bodyes dede,		To search in the heap of dead bodies,
1006	Hem for to strepe of harneys and of wede,		To strip them of armor and of clothing,
1007	The pilours diden bisynesse and cure		The scavengers took great pains and worked hard
1008	After the bataille and disconfiture.		After the battle and defeat.

1011	Two yonge knyghtes liggynge by and by,		Two young knights lying side by side,
1012	Bothe in oon armes, wroght ful richely,		Both with the same coat of arms, very richly wrought,

1014	And that oother knyght highte Palamon.		And that other knight was called Palamon.
1015	Nat fully quyke, ne fully dede they were,		They were not fully alive, nor fully dead,
1016	But by hir cote-armures and by hir gere		But by their coats of arms and by their equipment
1017	The heraudes knewe hem best in special		The heralds best knew them in particular
1018	As they that weren of the blood roial		As they that were of the royal blood
1019	Of Thebes, and of sustren two yborn.		Of Thebes, and born of two sisters.
1020	Out of the taas the pilours han hem torn,		The scavengers have pulled them out of the heap,
1021	And han hem caried softe unto the tente		And have carried them softy unto the tent
1022	Of Theseus; and he ful soone hem sente		Of Theseus; and he very soon sent them
1023	To Atthenes, to dwellen in prisoun		To Athens, to dwell in prison
1024	Perpetuelly -- he nolde no raunsoun.		Perpetually -- he would not (accept) any ransom.
1025	And whan this worthy duc hath thus ydon,		And when this worthy duke has thus done,
1026	He took his hoost, and hoom he rit anon		He took his army, and home he rides straightway
1027	With laurer crowned as a conquerour;		As a conqueror crowned with laurel;

1125	"Wheither seistow this in ernest or in pley?"		"Sayest thou this in earnest or in play?"

1396	Ne for the drede of deeth shal I nat spare		Nor shall I refrain for the dread of death
1397	To se my lady, that I love and serve.		From seeing my lady, whom I love and serve.
1398	In hire presence I recche nat to sterve."		In her presence I care not if I die."
1399	And with that word he caughte a greet mirour,		And with that word he picked up a large mirror,
1400	And saugh that chaunged was al his colour,		And saw that all his color was changed,
1401	And saugh his visage al in another kynde.		And saw his visage all (changed) to another sort.
1402	And right anon it ran hym in his mynde,		And right away it ran to him in his mind,
1403	That, sith his face was so disfigured		That, since his face was so disfigured
1404	Of maladye the which he hadde endured,		By the malady which he had endured,
1405	He myghte wel, if that he bar hym lowe,		He might well, if he conducted himself humbly,
1406	Lyve in Atthenes everemoore unknowe,		Live in Athens evermore unknown,
1407	And seen his lady wel ny day by day.		And see his lady almost every day.
1408	And right anon he chaunged his array,		And right away he changed his clothing,
1409	And cladde hym as a povre laborer,		And clad himself as a poor laborer,
1410	And al allone, save oonly a squier		And all alone, except only a squire
1411	That knew his privetee and al his cas,		Who knew his private affairs and all his situation,
1412	Which was disgised povrely as he was,		Who was disguised as poorly as he was,
1413	To Atthenes is he goon the nexte way.		To Athens he is gone the nearest way.
1414	And to the court he wente upon a day,		And to the court he went upon a day,
1415	And at the gate he profreth his servyse		And at the gate he offers his service
1416	To drugge and drawe, what so men wol devyse.		To drudge and draw water, whatever men will command.
1417	And shortly of this matere for to seyn,		And shortly to speak of this matter,
1418	He fil in office with a chamberleyn		He was given employment by a household attendant
1419	The which that dwellynge was with Emelye,		Who was dwelling with Emelye,

1422	Wel koude he hewen wode, and water bere,		He could well hew wood, and carry water,
1423	For he was yong and myghty for the nones,		For he was young and mighty indeed,
1424	And therto he was long and big of bones		And moreover he was tall and strong of bones
1425	To doon that any wight kan hym devyse.		To do what any one can command him.
1426	A yeer or two he was in this servyse,		A year or two he was in this service,
1427	Page of the chambre of Emelye the brighte,		Page of the chamber of Emelye the bright,
1428	And Philostrate he seyde that he highte.		And he said that he was called Philostrate.
1429	But half so wel biloved a man as he		But half so well beloved a man as he
1430	Ne was ther nevere in court of his degree;		Was never in court (anyone) of his rank;
1431	He was so gentil of condicioun		He was so noble in manner
1432	That thurghout al the court was his renoun.		That his fame was (spread) throughout all the court .
1433	They seyden that it were a charitee		They said that it would be a act of charity
1434	That Theseus wolde enhauncen his degree,		If Theseus would advance his rank,
1435	And putten hym in worshipful servyse,		And put him in noble employment,
1436	Ther as he myghte his vertu excercise.		Where he could exercise his abilities.
1437	And thus withinne a while his name is spronge,		And thus within a short time his fame is sprung,
1438	Bothe of his dedes and his goode tonge,		Both for his deeds and his good speech,
1439	That Theseus hath taken hym so neer		That Theseus has taken him so near
1440	That of his chambre he made hym a squier,		That he has made him a squire of his chamber,
1441	And gaf hym gold to mayntene his degree.		And gave him gold to maintain (a life style suitable to) his rank.
1442	And eek men broghte hym out of his contree,		And also men brought him out of his country,
1443	From yeer to yeer, ful pryvely his rente;		From year to year, very secretly, his income;
1444	But honestly and slyly he it spente,		But properly and slyly he spent it,
1445	That no man wondred how that he it hadde.		So that no man wondered how he acquired it.
1446	And thre yeer in this wise his lif he ladde,		And three years in this manner he led his life,
1447	And bar hym so, in pees and eek in werre,		And conducted himself so that, in peace and also in war,
1448	Ther was no man that Theseus hath derre.		There was no man whom Theseus holds dearer.
1449	And in this blisse lete I now Arcite,		And in this bliss I now leave Arcite,
1450	And speke I wole of Palamon a lite.		And I will speak of Palamon a little.
1451	In derknesse and horrible and strong prisoun		In darkness and horrible and strong imprisonment
1452	Thise seven yeer hath seten Palamoun		These seven years Palamon has sat
1453	Forpyned, what for wo and for distresse.		Wasted by suffering, what for woe and for distress.
1454	Who feeleth double soor and hevynesse		Who feels double pain and sadness
1455	But Palamon, that love destreyneth so		But Palamon, whom love so afflicts
1456	That wood out of his wit he goth for wo?		That he goes mad, out of his wits because of woe?
1457	And eek therto he is a prisoner		And also moreover he is a prisoner
1458	Perpetuelly, noght oonly for a yer.		Perpetually, not just for a year.
1459	Who koude ryme in Englyssh proprely		Who could rime in English properly
1460	His martirdom? For sothe it am nat I;		His martyrdom? In truth it is not I;
1461	Therfore I passe as lightly as I may.		Therefore I pass on as quickly as I can.
1462	It fel that in the seventhe yer, of May		It happened that in the seventh year, of May
1463	The thridde nyght (as olde bookes seyn,		The third night (as old books say,
1464	That al this storie tellen moore pleyn),		That tell all this story more fully),
1465	Were it by aventure or destynee --		Whether it was by chance or fate --
1466	As, whan a thyng is shapen, it shal be --		As, when a thing is pre-ordained, it must be --
1467	That soone after the mydnyght Palamoun,		That soon after midnight Palamon,
1468	By helpyng of a freend, brak his prisoun		With the help of a friend, broke out of his prison
1469	And fleeth the citee faste as he may go.		And flees the city as fast as he can go.
1470	For he hadde yeve his gayler drynke so		For he had so given his jailer drink
1471	Of a clarree maad of a certeyn wyn,		Of a spiced and sweetened drink made of a certain wine,
1472	With nercotikes and opie of Thebes fyn,		With narcotics and pure opium of Thebes,

1475	And thus he fleeth as faste as evere he may.		And thus he flees as fast as ever he can.
1476	The nyght was short and faste by the day		The night was short and very close to the day
1477	That nedes cost he moot hymselven hyde,		So that by necessity he must hide himself,
1478	And til a grove faste ther bisyde		And to a grove close by
1479	With dredeful foot thanne stalketh Palamon.		With fearful foot then stalks Palamon.
1480	For, shortly, this was his opinion:		For, shortly, this was his idea:
1481	That in that grove he wolde hym hyde al day,		That in that grove he would hide himself all day,
1482	And in the nyght thanne wolde he take his way		And in the night then he would take his way
1483	To Thebes-ward, his freendes for to preye		Toward Thebes, to pray his friends
1484	On Theseus to helpe him to werreye;		To help him to wage war on Theseus;
1485	And shortly, outher he wolde lese his lif		And shortly, he would either lose his life
1486	Or wynnen Emelye unto his wyf.		Or win Emelye to be his wife.
1487	This is th'effect and his entente pleyn.		This is the purpose and his full intent.
1488	Now wol I turne to Arcite ageyn,		Now I will turn again to Arcite,
1489	That litel wiste how ny that was his care,		That little knew how near his trouble was,
1490	Til that Fortune had broght him in the snare.		To which Fortune had brought him in the snare.
1491	The bisy larke, messager of day,		The busy lark, messenger of day,
1492	Salueth in hir song the morwe gray,		Salutes the morning gray in her song,
1493	And firy Phebus riseth up so bright		And fiery Phoebus rises up so bright
1494	That al the orient laugheth of the light,		That all the orient laughs because of the light,
1495	And with his stremes dryeth in the greves		And with his rays dries in the groves
1496	The silver dropes hangynge on the leves.		The silver drops hanging on the leaves.
1497	And Arcita, that in the court roial		And Arcite, who in the royal court
1498	With Theseus is principal squier,		With Theseus is chief squire,
1499	Is risen and looketh on the myrie day.		Is risen and looks on the merry day.
1500	And for to doon his observaunce to May,		And to do his observance to May,
1501	Remembrynge on the poynt of his desir,		Meditating on the object of his desire,
1502	He on a courser, startlynge as the fir,		He on a war horse, leaping about like the fire,
1503	Is riden into the feeldes hym to pleye,		Has ridden into the fields to amuse himself,
1504	Out of the court, were it a myle or tweye.		Out of the court, about a mile or two.
1505	And to the grove of which that I yow tolde		And to the grove of which I told you
1506	By aventure his wey he gan to holde		By chance he began to hold his way
1507	To maken hym a gerland of the greves,		To make himself a garland of the branches,
1508	Were it of wodebynde or hawethorn leves,		Were it of woodbine or hawthorn leaves,
1509	And loude he song ayeyn the sonne shene:		And loud he sang in the bright sun:
1510	"May, with alle thy floures and thy grene,		"May, with all thy flowers and thy greenery,
1511	Welcome be thou, faire, fresshe May,		Welcome be thou, fair, fresh May,
1512	In hope that I som grene gete may."		In hope that I can get something green."
1513	And from his courser, with a lusty herte,		And from his war horse, with an eager heart,
1514	Into the grove ful hastily he sterte,		He rushed into the grove hastily,
1515	And in a path he rometh up and doun,		And in a path he roams up and down,
1516	Ther as by aventure this Palamoun		Where by chance this Palamon
1517	Was in a bussh, that no man myghte hym se,		Was in a thicket, so that no man could see him,
1518	For soore afered of his deeth was he.		For he was sorely afraid of his death.
1519	No thyng ne knew he that it was Arcite;		In no way did he know that it was Arcite;
1520	God woot he wolde have trowed it ful lite.		God knows he would scarcely have believed it
1521	But sooth is seyd, go sithen many yeres,		But truly it is said, since many years ago,
1522	That "feeld hath eyen and the wode hath eres."		That "field has eyes and the wood has ears."
1523	It is ful fair a man to bere hym evene,		It is very good for a man to act calmly,
1524	For al day meeteth men at unset stevene.		For every day people meet at unexpected times.
1525	Ful litel woot Arcite of his felawe,		Arcite knows full little of his fellow,
1526	That was so ny to herknen al his sawe,		Who was near enough to hear all his speech,
1527	For in the bussh he sitteth now ful stille.		For in the thicket he sits now very still.
1528	Whan that Arcite hadde romed al his fille,		When Arcite had roamed all his fill,
1529	And songen al the roundel lustily,		And sung all the rondel cheerfully,
1530	Into a studie he fil sodeynly,	nbsp;	He fell suddenly into a state of anxiety,
1531	As doon thise loveres in hir queynte geres,		As these lovers do in their strange manners,
1532	Now in the crope, now doun in the breres,		Now in the tree top, now down in the briars,
1533	Now up, now doun, as boket in a welle.		Now up, now down, like a bucket in a well.
1534	Right as the Friday, soothly for to telle,		Exactly like the Friday, truly for to tell,
1535	Now it shyneth, now it reyneth faste,		Now it shines, now it rains hard,
1536	Right so kan geery Venus overcaste		Just so can fickle Venus sadden
1537	The hertes of hir folk; right as hir day		The hearts of her folk; just as her day
1538	Is gereful, right so chaungeth she array.		Is changeable, just so she changes her array.
1539	Selde is the Friday al the wowke ylike.		Friday is seldom like all the rest of the week.
1540	Whan that Arcite had songe, he gan to sike		When Arcite had sung, he began to sigh
1541	And sette hym doun withouten any moore.		And sat himself down without any more.
1542	"Allas," quod he, "that day that I was bore!		"Alas," he said, "that day that I was born!
1543	How longe, Juno, thurgh thy crueltee,		How long, Juno, through thy cruelty,
1544	Woltow werreyen Thebes the citee?		Wilt thou make war on the city of Thebes?
1545	Allas, ybroght is to confusioun		Alas, to ruin is brought
1546	The blood roial of Cadme and Amphioun --		The royal blood of Cadmus and Amphion --
1547	Of Cadmus, which that was the firste man		Of Cadmus, who was the first man
1548	That Thebes bulte, or first the toun bigan,		Who built Thebes, before the town first began,
1549	And of the citee first was crouned kyng.		And first was crowned king of the city.
1550	Of his lynage am I and his ofspryng		I am of his lineage and his offspring
1551	By verray ligne, as of the stok roial,		By true lineage, of the royal family,
1552	And now I am so caytyf and so thral,		And now I am so wretched and so enslaved,
1553	That he that is my mortal enemy,		That he who is my mortal enemy,
1554	I serve hym as his squier povrely.		I meekly serve him as his squire.
1555	And yet dooth Juno me wel moore shame,		And yet Juno does me much more shame,
1556	For I dar noght biknowe myn owene name;		For I dare not acknowledge my own name;
1557	But ther as I was wont to highte Arcite,		But whereas I was accustomed to be called Arcite,
1558	Now highte I Philostrate, noght worth a myte.		Now I am called Philostrate, not worth a penny.
1559	Allas, thou felle Mars! Allas, Juno!		Alas, thou fierce Mars! Alas, Juno!
1560	Thus hath youre ire oure lynage al fordo,		Thus has your anger destroyed all our lineage,
1561	Save oonly me and wrecched Palamoun,		Save only me and wretched Palamon,
1562	That Theseus martireth in prisoun.		Whom Theseus torments in prison.
1563	And over al this, to sleen me outrely		And in addition to all this, to slay me utterly
1564	Love hath his firy dart so brennyngly		Love has his fiery dart so ardently
1565	Ystiked thurgh my trewe, careful herte		Stabbed through my faithful, sorrowful heart
1566	That shapen was my deeth erst than my sherte.		That my death was destined before my first garment was made.
1567	Ye sleen me with youre eyen, Emelye!		You slay me with your eyes, Emelye!
1568	Ye been the cause wherfore that I dye.		You are the cause by which I die.
1569	Of al the remenant of myn oother care		Of all the rest of my other troubles
1570	Ne sette I nat the montance of a tare,		I do not reckon at the value of a weed,
1571	So that I koude doon aught to youre plesaunce."		Provided that I could do anything to please you."
1572	And with that word he fil doun in a traunce		And with that word he fell down in a trance
1573	A longe tyme, and after he up sterte.		A long time, and afterwards he leaped up.
1574	This Palamoun, that thoughte that thurgh his herte		This Palamon, that thought that through his heart
1575	He felte a coold swerd sodeynliche glyde,		He felt a cold sword suddenly glide,
1576	For ire he quook; no lenger wolde he byde.		For anger he trembled; no longer would he wait.
1577	And whan that he had herd Arcites tale,		And when he had heard Arcite's tale,
1578	As he were wood, with face deed and pale,		As if he were mad, with face dead and pale,
1579	He stirte hym up out of the buskes thikke		He leaped up out of the thick bushes
1580	And seide: "Arcite, false traytour wikke,		And said: "Arcite, false, wicked traitor,
1581	Now artow hent, that lovest my lady so,		Now art thou taken, who lovest my lady so,
1582	For whom that I have al this peyne and wo,		For whom that I have all this pain and woe,
1583	And art my blood, and to my conseil sworn,		And art of my blood, and sworn to be in my confidence,
1584	As I ful ofte have told thee heerbiforn,		As I full often have told thee before now,
1585	And hast byjaped heere duc Theseus,		And hast tricked here duke Theseus,
1586	And falsly chaunged hast thy name thus!		And thus hast falsely changed thy name!
1587	I wol be deed, or elles thou shalt dye.		I will be dead, or else thou shalt die.
1588	Thou shalt nat love my lady Emelye,		Thou shalt not love my lady Emelye,
1589	But I wol love hire oonly and namo;		But I will love her only and no other;
1590	For I am Palamon, thy mortal foo.		For I am Palamon, thy mortal foe.
1591	And though that I no wepene have in this place,		And though I have no weapon in this place,
1592	But out of prison am astert by grace,		But out of prison am escaped by good luck,
1593	I drede noght that outher thow shalt dye,		I doubt not that either thou shalt dye,
1594	Or thow ne shalt nat loven Emelye.		Either thou shalt not love Emelye,
1595	Chees which thou wolt, or thou shalt nat asterte!"		Choose which thou wish, or thou shalt not escape!"
1596	This Arcite, with ful despitous herte,		This Arcite, with full spiteful heart,
1597	Whan he hym knew, and hadde his tale herd,		When he knew him, and had heard his tale,
1598	As fiers as leon pulled out his swerd,		As fierce as a lion pulled out his sword,
1599	And seyde thus: "By God that sit above,		And said thus: "By God who sits above,
1600	Nere it that thou art sik and wood for love,		Were it not that thou art sick and mad for love,
1601	And eek that thow no wepne hast in this place,		And also because thou hast no weapon in this place,
1602	Thou sholdest nevere out of this grove pace,		Thou shouldest never walk out of this grove,
1603	That thou ne sholdest dyen of myn hond.		Rather thou shouldest die of my hand.
1604	For I defye the seurete and the bond		For I repudiate the pledge and the bond
1605	Which that thou seist that I have maad to thee.		Which thou sayest that I have made to thee.
1606	What! Verray fool, thynk wel that love is free,		Lo! True fool, think well that love is free,
1607	And I wol love hire maugree al thy myght!		And I will love her in spite of all thy might!
1608	But for as muche thou art a worthy knyght		But for as much as thou art a worthy knight
1609	And wilnest to darreyne hire by bataille,		And desire to decide the right to her by battle,
1610	Have heer my trouthe; tomorwe I wol nat faille,		Have here my pledge; tomorrow I will not fail,
1611	Withoute wityng of any oother wight,		Without the knowledge of any other person,
1612	That heere I wol be founden as a knyght,		But here I will be found as a knight,
1613	And bryngen harneys right ynough for thee;		And bring armor right enough for thee;
1614	And ches the beste, and leef the worste for me.		And choose the best, and leave the worst for me.
1615	And mete and drynke this nyght wol I brynge		And food and drink this night will I bring
1616	Ynough for thee, and clothes for thy beddynge.		Enough for thee, and bed-clothes for thy bedding.
1617	And if so be that thou my lady wynne,		And if it so be that thou win my lady,
1618	And sle me in this wode ther I am inne,		And slay me in this wood where I am in,
1619	Thow mayst wel have thy lady as for me."		Thou mayest well have thy lady as far as I am concerned."
1620	This Palamon answerde, "I graunte it thee."		This Palamon answered, "I agree."
1621	And thus they been departed til amorwe,		And thus they are departed until morning,
1622	Whan ech of hem had leyd his feith to borwe.		When each of them had laid his faith as a pledge.
1623	O Cupide, out of alle charitee!		O Cupid, devoid of all kindness to others!
1624	O regne, that wolt no felawe have with thee!		O reign, that will have no partner with thee!
1625	Ful sooth is seyd that love ne lordshipe		Full truly it is said that love nor lordship
1626	Wol noght, his thankes, have no felaweshipe.		Will not, willingly, have any partnership.
1627	Wel fynden that Arcite and Palamoun.		Arcite and Palamon well find that (to be true).
1628	Arcite is riden anon unto the toun,		Arcite has ridden immediately into the town,
1629	And on the morwe, er it were dayes light,		And on the morning, before it was day's light,
1630	Ful prively two harneys hath he dight,		Very secretly he has prepared two sets of armor,
1631	Bothe suffisaunt and mete to darreyne		Both sufficient and suitable to decide
1632	The bataille in the feeld bitwix hem tweyne;		The battle in the field between them two;
1633	And on his hors, allone as he was born,		And on his horse, alone as he was born,
1634	He carieth al the harneys hym biforn.		He carries all the armor before him.
1635	And in the grove, at tyme and place yset,		And in the grove, at time and place set,
1636	This Arcite and this Palamon ben met.		This Arcite and this Palamon are met.
1637	To chaungen gan the colour in hir face;		The color in their faces began to change;
1638	Right as the hunters in the regne of Trace,		Just as the hunters in the reign of Thrace,
1639	That stondeth at the gappe with a spere,		He who stands at the gap in the forrest with a spear,
1640	Whan hunted is the leon or the bere,		When the lion or the bear is hunted,
1641	And hereth hym come russhyng in the greves,		And hears him come rushing in the bushes,
1642	And breketh bothe bowes and the leves,		And breaks both boughs and the leaves,
1643	And thynketh, "Heere cometh my mortal enemy!		And thinks, "Here comes my mortal enemy!
1644	Withoute faille, he moot be deed, or I,		Without fail, he must be dead, or I,
1645	For outher I moot sleen hym at the gappe,		For either I must slay him at the gap,
1646	Or he moot sleen me, if that me myshappe."		Or he must slay me, if I suffer misfortune."
1647	So ferden they in chaungyng of hir hewe,		So fared they in changing colors of their faces,
1648	As fer as everich of hem oother knewe.		When each of them knew the other.
1649	Ther nas no good day, ne no saluyng,		There was no 'good day,' nor no salutations,
1650	But streight, withouten word or rehersyng,		But straightway, without word or conversing,
1651	Everich of hem heelp for to armen oother		Each one of them helped to arm the other
1652	As freendly as he were his owene brother;		As friendly as if he were his own brother;
1653	And after that, with sharpe speres stronge		And after that, with sharp strong spears
1654	They foynen ech at oother wonder longe.		They thrust at each other a wonderfully long time.
1655	Thou myghtest wene that this Palamon		Thou mightest suppose that this Palamon
1656	In his fightyng were a wood leon,		In his fighting was a mad lion,
1657	And as a crueel tigre was Arcite;		And Arcite was like a cruel tiger;
1658	As wilde bores gonne they to smyte,		They began to smite like wild boars,
1659	That frothen whit as foom for ire wood.		That froth at the mouth white as foam for mad anger.
1660	Up to the ancle foghte they in hir blood.		They fought up to the ankle in their blood.

1763	He hath considered shortly, in a clause,		He has considered shortly, in brief,

1817	As he that hath ben caught ofte in his laas,		As one who has been often caught in its snare,
1818	I yow foryeve al hoolly this trespaas,		I wholly forgive you this trespass,
1819	At requeste of the queene, that kneleth heere,		At the request of the queen, who kneels here,
