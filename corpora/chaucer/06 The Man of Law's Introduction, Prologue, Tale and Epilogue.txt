134	In Surrye whilom dwelte a compaignye	In Syria once dwelt a company
135	Of chapmen riche, and therto sadde and trewe,	Of rich merchants, and moreover trustworthy and true,

152	Reported was, with every circumstance,	Was reported, in full detail,
153	Unto thise Surryen marchantz in swich wyse,	Unto these Syrian merchants in such a manner,
154	Fro day to day, as I shal yow devyse.	From day to day, as I shall tell you.
155	This was the commune voys of every man:	This was the common opinion of every man:
156	"Oure Emperour of Rome -- God hym see! --	"Our Emperor of Rome -- may God look after him! --
157	A doghter hath that, syn the world bigan,	A daughter has that, since the world began,
158	To rekene as wel hir goodnesse as beautee,	To consider as well her goodness as beauty,
159	Nas nevere swich another as is shee.	There was never such another as is she.
160	I prey to God in honour hire susteene,	I pray to God to sustain her in honor,
161	And wolde she were of al Europe the queene.	And would she were of all Europe the queen.
162	"In hire is heigh beautee, withoute pride,	"In her is great beauty, without pride,
163	Yowthe, withoute grenehede or folye;	Youth, without immaturity or folly;
164	To alle hire werkes vertu is hir gyde;	In all her deeds virtue is her guide;
165	Humblesse hath slayn in hire al tirannye.	Humility has slain in her all tyranny.
166	She is mirour of alle curteisye;	She is mirror of all courtesy;
167	Hir herte is verray chambre of hoolynesse,	Her heart is a true chamber of holiness,
168	Hir hand, ministre of fredam for almesse."	Her hand, minister of generosity in giving alms."
169	And al this voys was sooth, as God is trewe.	And all this opinion was true, as God is true.

177	Of hym that was the Sowdan of Surrye;	Of him that was the Sultan of Syria;
178	For whan they cam from any strange place,	For when they came from any foreign place,
